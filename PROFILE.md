## About Me

*Optional: A sentence or two about your design interests. This could seed your eventual portfolio bio.*

<!-- 
Example: "I'm drawn to motion design and systems thinking. 
Currently exploring how interaction design can feel more human."
-->
I enjoy web design and futzing around in Illustrator. Recently, I have been trying more physical mediums, like sewing and painting on fabric, because I want to make a bunch of my own stuff! And you didn't ask, but I have a cat ₍^. .^₎⟆
