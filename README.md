## About This Repository

This is my workspace for **DESN 378 Code + Design 2** also known as **Web Design 2** (or in the future, **Web Design + Code 2**) at Eastern Washington University. **The question this course asks:** How should things behave? In DESN 368, I learned how to make things look right. Here, I'm learning how to make things behave right — treating code as a design material with properties, behaviors, and constraints, just like paint, paper, or clay. Throughout the quarter, I'll work with four digital materials: CSS systems, SVG, animation libraries, and generative code — learning how each responds to manipulation and what each makes possible. Unlike courses focused on user research or backend engineering, this one asks: How does it feel? By the end, this repo will become my portfolio.

# Learning Log​
## Week 3​
### What I Learned
Learned about Figma variables and how to apply those to a Figma design with the intention of later translating that to code. I also learned about switching between light and dark modes.​
​
### What Was Hard
I'm not particularly staying on top on things. Just not super motivated right now + other schoolwork with bigger priorities. The Figma variable narrator was soooo boring, and it was hard to stay focused.​
​
### How I Used AI
I did not use it last week, except for helping with merging branches in GitHub.​
​
### What's Still Unclear
Still a little lost on Figma variables, but I think that's mostly due to a lack of practice. Finding where the "Apply Variables" button is can be annoying sometimes.

​
## Week 2​
### What I Learned
I learned more about JavaScript interactions, like how to update text, images, buttons, and colors using a for-loop to iterate through different states without linking to a new page each time.
​
​
### What Was Hard
Trying to keep track of all the moving parts of JavaScript. Plus, trying to remember all the necessary syntax for all of it. Also, all my other classes gave me a whole bunch of work :|​
​
### How I Used AI
I can't quite remember what all I did, but I may have asked an AI to help my button update alongside the picture.​
​
### What's Still Unclear
More general work with JS and figuring out all the bits.

​
## Week 1​
### What I Learned
<!-- What concepts clicked for you? What was new? -->
I learned about how you can select specific items through the console/.js files. Alongside that, I discovered how to use JavaScript to make visual and text-based changes. We also covered eventListeners and how those will watch for a specfic action to be taken before running whatever function/code is contained inside them.
​
​
### What Was Hard
<!-- What frustrated you? What didn't make sense? -->
GitHub is the biggest learning curve so far. I'm having issues with file management and linking things correctly. The most annoying part so far has been that everything displays correctly in the codespace, but not on my live Pages site. I'm sure there's an easy fix, I'm just not aware of it yet. Specifically, I have working js and css files in my codespace, but when I sync changes and open the Behavioral Tutorial from my Learning Log page, none of that fun stuff is there :(​
​
### How I Used AI
<!-- Did you use Copilot, ChatGPT, etc.? How did it help or not help? -->
I mostly used it for mundane things, like removing broken characters. There was one time where it helped me recover my work after I messed up syncing changes to the repo.​
​
### What's Still Unclear
<!-- What questions do you still have? What needs more practice? -->
Some of the syntax used in JavaScript is still new to me, so I need more exposure to that and what all that means.​
